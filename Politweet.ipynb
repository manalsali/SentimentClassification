In addition, we aim at improving the scores given by Amazon Mechanical Turks, which do not grade the tweets with this depth of details. However, we use the AMT ratings only when all the ratings are equal. We use this our label for our training set.\n",

    "3. Machine learning techniques\n",

    "Our assumption is that given the specificity of the topic, open-domain machine learning techniques for sentiment analysis, such as Socher 2014 (Recursive Neural Networks) would not satisfy our needs in this particular case, since we may want to train the network with data that are more precise to our problem, however our dataset is too small to do such test. Hence, we attempt at using existing lexicons such as SentiWordnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "After our exporatory data analysis stage, we found that there are very simple rules that we can understand from the different tweets. For example, \"-3 Obama\" is a notation that is used in the tweets to specify that the user disagree with something Obama has said, hence we can can collect rules of this kind and build a rule-based system for sentiment analysis. In addition, we plan to use the outcome of the different rules into a classifier and learn their weights."
